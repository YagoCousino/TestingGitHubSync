      "description": "As a Product Manager, I am passionate about creating digital products that connect people and businesses with common goals, interests, and values. In 2018, I began my journey at Manfred as part of a team of two and a half people. In 2020, with a team of seven people, we sold the company to Sngular to take it to new heights. During my time at Manfred, I had the opportunity to work in sales, internal hiring, and operations, which helped me understand how to make a company profitable.\n\nAdditionally, in 2017, I founded The Wing with the goal of establishing a new standard in sports journalism. I learned a lot about the industry and myself during this experience. Currently, I continue to work in the sports field alongside the team at La Media Inglesa, a media outlet about English football that has multiplied its revenue fivefold in two years.\n\nI am always looking for opportunities to connect with the technical community and stay up-to-date on the latest trends. I have organized events such as NOSDay, Cañas A La Madrileña, and TarugoConf."

Therefore, we faced the challenge of transitioning from a service company to a hybrid one while maintaining the quality of our processes.\n\nTo achieve this, we grew from a team of around 15 people to one of over 40, stabilizing the hiring between product and services. The same values were at the core of Manfred, and we made sure they remained so despite the growth.\n\nIn Product, we built a team from scratch with the following objectives:\n\nCreate our own technology to have the largest active candidate base in our niche in Spain.\n-Provide recruiting teams with tools to improve their work and automate processes.\n-Build an instrumentation system using Segment and Amplitude to make informed decisions and be efficient with our resources.\n-Become the default tool companies turn to for sourcing candidates.\n\nCreating a green field product, we were able to increase the size of our database tenfold in 3 years, reaching 30,000. We improved the processes of the recruiting team and increased their productivity in a context of greater complexity, while establishing an actionable data dashboard.\n\nFurthermore, we employed a continuous value delivery approach under which we are deploying and delivering improvements to our users frequently (almost) weekly, keeping technical debt under control."

One of the biggest challenges has been developing a revenue network practically from scratch and professionalizing the project. To achieve this, I have worked on generating different income sources and building relationships with sponsors, all with very limited resources. \n\nTo improve our strategic direction, we have eliminated inefficient processes and automated both organizational and web store processes, significantly improving the team's efficiency. Additionally, I introduced modern tools and work culture, such as Slack and Trello, to optimize coordination, reduce errors, and increase the effectiveness of a team that has grown from four people in 2020 to eight people currently."

Our first challenge was to capitalize on inefficiencies in the technology recruitment sector, which treated people like numbers. While we had a clear understanding of our values and purpose, as well as the community of developers and companies that shared our objectives, we still needed to find an effective sales process.\n\nFrom the start, I sought to impact every aspect of our service design cycle and the \"architecture\" of \"no-code\" applications, which allowed us to create a 7-figure revenue machine in just a few months.\n\nFurthermore, I played a key role in growing our team from two full-time employees to 44 and still expanding. Initially, I focused on executing sales and creating flows that could be replicated across the team, before moving into Product and Training tasks.\n\n\"We went to war armed with teaspoons and survived.\"\n\nIn April 2020, amidst a pandemic, our company was acquired by Sngular, allowing us to continue growing and developing multiple digital products that had a real impact on Spain's technical community."
